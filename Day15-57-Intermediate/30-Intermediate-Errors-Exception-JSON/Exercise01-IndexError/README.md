Issue
We've got some buggy code. Try running the code. The code will crash and give you an IndexError. This is because we're looking through the list of fruits for an index that is out of range.

Bad Output

Instructions
Use what you've learnt about exception handling to prevent the program from crashing. If the user enters something that is out of range just print a default output of "Fruit pie". e.g.

Hint
You'll need to catch the IndexError exception.

You'll need the try, except and else keywords.
